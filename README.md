# Room - Final
This was a program I coded in Visual Basic in 2024 for a competition in my Computer Programming class at the Greater Altoona Career and Technology Center.

# What is this program?
It's essentially a simple escape room game with some horror aspects.
 
 
 
 
# Here's a helpful tip
By the way, when you get caught, you click on the form that pops up (the "death screen") which it will then prompt you if you want to try again. Also on the part with the safe, you click the up arrow until you reach the first digit of the code to unlock it, down arrow till you reach the second digit then finally up arrow till you reach the third digit (this is included as a hint in the death screen, but hints are randomized so there's no guarantee that users would see it).
